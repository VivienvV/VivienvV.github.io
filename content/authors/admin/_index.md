I am a PhD Candidate in Artificial Intelligence for Breast Cancer Research, working with Jonas Teuwen and Eric Marcus as part of the [AI for Oncology Lab](https://aiforoncology.nl/) at the Netherlands Cancer Institute. I am also part of the Breast Imaging Group of Ritse Mann at the Radboud University Medical Centre.  In addition, I work closely with Katja Pinker-Domenig at the [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/doctors/katja-pinker-domenig).

My research concerns the use of fundamental deep learning and computer vision for enhancing breast cancer care.
