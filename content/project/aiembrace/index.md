Breast cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among women worldwide, with early detection and better treatment playing crucial roles in improving patient outcomes. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in the analysis of breast imaging has the potential to revolutionize the field of breast cancer diagnostics and guide treatment decisions. This project aims to develop personalized, risk-based strategies for breast cancer detection and treatment, minimizing the impact of this disease on both individuals and society.

The components of this project are:
- Evaluating image-based risk assessment for women undergoing screening examinations in order to enhance personalized screening strategies.
- Developing a detection module that can assist in breast cancer assessment within breast MRI, increasing diagnostic accuracy.
- Determining the potential of AI to adequately predict and monitor response to neoadjuvant treatment for women diagnosed with breast cancer to inform therapeutic decisions better.
- Creating an AI aid in surveillance for cancer recurrence post-surgery, providing valuable insights into patient prognosis and the need for further intervention.

The modules for risk assessment, cancer detection, neoadjuvant therapy response, and surveillance will analyze various breast imaging modalities, with a specific focus on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the most sensitive breast imaging technique currently available. 

This project advances personalized breast cancer care by using AI to analyze longitudinal patient-specific data, with a specific focus on developing explainable AI systems which will foster trust and enhance the acceptance of AI in clinical settings. This initiative bridges the gap between AI technology and its practical application, supporting the entire patient journey, from detection to treatment and surveillance.
